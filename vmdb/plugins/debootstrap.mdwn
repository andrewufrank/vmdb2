Step: `debootstrap`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install packages using apt, which needs to already have been
installed.

Step keys:

* `debootstrap` &mdash; REQUIRED; value is the codename of the Debian
  release to install: `stretch`, `buster`, etc.

* `target` &mdash; REQUIRED; value is the tag for the root filesystem.

* `mirror` &mdash; OPTIONAL; which Debian mirror to use

* `keyring` &mdash; OPTIONAL; which gpg keyring to use to verify the packages. This is useful when using a non-official Debian repository (e.g. Raspbian) as by default debootstrap will use the keys provided by the "debian-archive-keyring" package.

Example (in the .vmdb file):

    - debootstrap: buster
      target: root
      mirror: http://mirror.example.com/debian
      keyring: /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
