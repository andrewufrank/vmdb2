NEWS for vmdb2, the Debian disk image builder
=============================================================================

Version 0.3+git, not yet released
---------------------------------


Version 0.3, released 2017-05-21
---------------------------------

* Simplify progress reporting to go to stdout, plus stop logging
  progress reports ar as errors.

* Add a BIOS flavor for installing GRUB.

Version 0.2, released 2017-05-14
---------------------------------

* Add plugin to provide steps to cache the rootfs, and to unpack the
  rootfs from the cache, instead of running debootstrap or installing
  packages. This speeds up iteration time from about 9 minutes to 40
  seconds on my laptop. See small.vmdb for an example.

* Add a generic "unless this condition is true" functionality to
  steps. If a step has a field "unless: foo" it is skipped the
  variable foo exists and is true. The variables are set by steps, and
  currently only the rootfs unpacking step sets a variable (the
  `rootfs_unpacked` variable). This allows debootstrap to be skipped
  if the rootfs has already been created by unpacking a cached
  tarball.

Version 0.1, released 2017-05-13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release. It can build a UEFI image for the amd64
architecture. It's not meant to really be useful for other people.
