README for vmdb2 or vmdebootstrap 2nd generation
=============================================================================

vmdb2 is a program for producing a disk image with Debian installed.

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[vmdebootstrap][] installs Debian onto a disk, or disk image. It is
like the [debootstrap][] tool, except the end result is a disk or disk
image, not a directory. vmdebootstrap takes care of creating
partitions, and filesystems, and allows some more customization than
vmdebootstrap does.

vmdebootstrap is also a messy pile of kludge, and not flexible enough.
vmdb2 is a re-implementation from scratch, without a need for
backwards compatibility. It aims to provide more flexibility than
vmdeboostrap, without becoming anywhere near as complicated. Think of
vmdb2 as "vmdebootstrap the second generation". The name has changed
to allow the two tools to installable in paralllel.

The main user-visible difference between vmdebootstrap and vmdb2 is
that the older program provides extensibitlity via a legion of command
line options and the newer program by having the user user a domain
specific language to express what kind of Debian system they want to
create.

(Lars Wirzenius wrote both vmdebootstrap and vmdb2 and is entitled to
sneer at his younger self.)

Hacking
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run automated tests:

    ./check

You'll need the yarn program (part of the [cmdtest][] package), and
also [CoverageTestRunner][] for running the unit tests.
