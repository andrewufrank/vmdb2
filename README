README for vmdb2 or vmdebootstrap 2nd generation
=============================================================================

FIXME: Write this README. Meanwhile, vmdb2 is a from-scratch
re-invention of the vmdebootstrap program. It is not backwards
compatible. Where the old program tried to control everything via a
very large number of configuration settings, the new one reads a
specification file, essentially a domain-specific language for disk
image building.
